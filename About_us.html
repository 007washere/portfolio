    My name is Abdurraqeeb Adeleye i was born in nigeria i came to america when i was eleven and i grew up in texas before moving to illinois.
    i think im a pretty chill person in my personal opinion and i do have quite a lot of hobbies. i like to read, bake, cook, listen to music and
    I like making music, im also a huge cinephile ive watched over 1000 movies in the last 3 years alone. i like to play basketball as my way of
    getting cardio because i hate running mindlessly. I like to code for fun sometimes for example im coding this website all by myself.
